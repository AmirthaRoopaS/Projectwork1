## Title of the Project
Dynamic Data Security in Cloud Environments Using Advanced Encryption Standard Techniques

## About
With the advent of cloud computing, cloud servers offer to their clients (cloud users) various services that include delegation of huge amounts of computation and outsourcing large amounts of data. For example, a client having a smartphone with a low-performance processor or limited storage cannot accomplish heavy computation or store large volumes of data. Under such circumstances, the user can delegate her computation/storage to the cloud server. Types of cloud computing – PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and HYBRID

## Features
- Safeguard sensitive information stored and processed in the cloud against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Develop a framework that adapts to varying security requirements, ensuring data remains secure while accessible to authorized users.
- Address challenges related to key generation, distribution, and storage to improve overall security without compromising usability.
  
## Requirements
* Data Collection
* Data Preprocessing

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
- A more efficient SNC protocol can give us a DSCS protocol with better efficiency.
- We have also identified certain SNC protocols suitable for append-only data and constructed an efficient DSCS protocol (DSCS II) for append only data.
